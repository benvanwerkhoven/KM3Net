/*
 * This file contains the CUDA implementation for a parallel prefix-sum kernel.
 *
 * Prefix sums are a common parallel algorithm mainly used in GPU Computing when
 * the number of outputs per thread is not constant. The prefix sum of an array
 * is an array that contains the sum of all preceeding elements in the original
 * array. If the value itself is included the prefix sum is considered to be
 * inclusive, and exclusive if the value itself is not included. As such, for an
 * exclusive prefix sum the first element is of the prefix sum array is always 0.
 * For an inclusive sum the last element of the prefix sum array contains the sum
 * of the input array.

/*
 * This is a small device function that will be inlined by the compiler in the CUDA kernel.
 *
 * This CUDA device function includes some in-line PTX code, for more info about inlining PTX see: 
 * http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/inline-ptx-assembly/index.html
 *
 * The reason to use predicated warp-shuffle instructions is because all threads in a warp need
 * to compute a sum of all preceeding elements. This is basically done in the same manner as for a
 * regular sum, where all threads in the end have the same sum value. However, by using predication we can
 * disable certain threads during the add instruction and ensure that threads only add values
 * previously owned by threads with a lower thread id than their own.
 *
 * This function operates at the warp-level and only computes the prefix sum within a 32-thread warp.

 * This kernel computes a block-wide prefix sum using the prefix_sum_warp function within warps.
 * The last thread of each warp writes the value that should carry over to the next warp into
 * the shared memory array warp_carry. Then within a single warp the prefix_sum of the warp carry
 * is computed, after which the warp carries are propagated to all warps. The kernel also writes
 * the block carry of the thread block into the global memory array block_carry.

 * After first kernel execution, which should use a zerod block_carray array as input, this same
 * kernel can be called again using the previously written block_carry array as input array,
 * to compute the prefix sum of all block carries. Finally, the propagate_block_carry kernel
 * can be used to propagate the block carry values to all elements.
