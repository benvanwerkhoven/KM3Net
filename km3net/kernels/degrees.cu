/* 
 * This kernel is meant to find the degree of a node in the correlations
 * table, which is stored in the (window_width_d x N) dense format
 *
 * The number of edges to nodes with a higher id is simply the number of entries
 * in the graph for a given node.
 *
 * To get the full degree of a node, it is necessary to look at the
 * edges of preceeding nodes to find any edges to itself. Fortunately, there
 * is a limit of at most 1500. That is to say, two nodes with ids more than 1500 apart
 * can never have an edge.
 *
 * The degree array is assumed to already contain the out-degree as computed by
 * the quadratic_difference_linear kernel, this kernel adds the in-degree of each node to that number
 * to obtain the total degree of the node.
