Utility functions documentation
===============================

This file provides detailed information about the utility functions 
module used by the KM3Net package internally. The utility package 
contains all kinds of functions from reading or generating input, 
processing the input, computing and plotting the output. Many of these 
functions are used by the test and tuning programs. However, these 
functions can also be of help when creating user applications.
