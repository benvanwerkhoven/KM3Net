Introduction
============

The software for the real-time detection of neutrinos in the new generation neutrino telescope.

This software package covers the implementation of a pipeline that
analyzes the hits that come out of the detector. The algorithm looks
for correlated hits and analyzes them to detect neutrinos passing
through the detector.
